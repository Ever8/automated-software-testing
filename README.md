# automated-software-testing

Here you can find some examples of my automated testing skills, such as testing in Selenium, unit tests, and API testing with Postman. 

While working as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer I was an active member of a Scrum development team, writing manual tests in Xray for Jira. 

I learned the basics of automated testing in my free time.
